{"name":"OpenMVS","tagline":"open Multi-View Stereo reconstruction library","body":"![OpenMVS Logo](http://cdcseacave.github.io/openMVS/images/logo.png)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n[OpenMVS (Multi-View Stereo)](http://cdcseacave.github.io/openMVS) is a library for computer-vision scientists and especially targeted to the Multi-View Stereo reconstruction community. While there are mature and complete open-source projects targeting Structure-from-Motion pipelines (like [OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG)) which recover camera poses and a sparse 3D point-cloud from an input set of images, there are none addressing the last part of the photogrammetry chain-flow. *OpenMVS* aims at filling that gap by providing a complete set of algorithms to recover the full surface of the scene to be reconstructed. The input is a set of camera poses plus the sparse point-cloud and the output is a textured mesh. The main topics covered by this project are:\r\n\r\n- **dense point-cloud reconstruction** for obtaining a complete and accurate as possible point-cloud\r\n- **mesh reconstruction** for estimating a mesh surface that explains the best the input point-cloud\r\n- **mesh refinement** for recovering all fine details\r\n- **mesh texturing** for computing a sharp and accurate texture to color the mesh\r\n\r\nSee the complete [documentation](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/wiki) on wiki.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nSee the [building](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/wiki/Building) wiki page.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee the [copyright](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.md) file.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n* Pierre Moulon for improving and validating the code, encouragements and support (plus project's logo)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nopenmvs[AT]googlegroups.com\r\n","google":"UA-66714336-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
